# Mario-Remake
## The Game
The game is a remake of the popular 1983 title ‚ÄúMario Bros. Arcade Co-Op‚Äù. The main objective of the game is to avoid all the enemies to collect the coins and/or hit Koopa shells of the screen to earn 800 points towards the final score. As well as hitting Koopas of the screen, the player can also collect coins which will add 800 points to the score. These coins will randomly spawn out of the 2 top pipes alongside the Koopas; however, they have a lower chance of spawning. In crucial life or death situations, the Pow Block can be struck to instantly collect all coins, injure all enemies, and destroy all fireballs on the screen to get out of a sticky situation. The game will end when both Mario and Luigi die to an enemy. At this point a ‚ÄúGame Over‚Äù screen will be presented to the player who can click to visit the leaderboard, this is where the score will be placed into a high scores table if it is within the top 10 local player scores. The player can then decide whether to play again or to go back to the menu screen.
